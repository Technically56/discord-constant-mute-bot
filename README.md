# discord-constant-mute-bot
(PS: I do not accept any kind of responsibilty for whatever this bot may be used for. I just made this as a silly joke for our discord server.)This is a discord bot that is used to disconnect or server mute someone rapidly. Simply add your bot to your server, copy and paste its token inside the python file, and run it with the correct packages installed
